title: Beginning JavaScript; learning HTML and CSS

Today marks the first day where I will be blogging and sharing my experience as I delve within JavaScript. Using [Jekyll](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), to set up my portfolio, I would want to document my journey from being a Self-taught developer into a Well-Seasoned Software Engineer like my good friend, [Andy Tan](andytan.me).

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
