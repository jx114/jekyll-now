## Monty Hall Website

  Following the footsteps on how to make websites, I decided to make a simple website that naviagates throughout different webpages that I have designed to mimic an appeareance of a game. In today's theme, we will be using the classic problem of Monty Hall where a player is presented with three doors and a prize of some sort is behind one door and then the rest of the other doors have a goat behind it. Once the player chooses the first door, the host of the game open one of the other door containing a goat behind it and would prompt the player if they would like to change their picks.

Although the game is quite simple, it is statisictically proven that 2/3 of the times where the player decided to make the switch has gotten the prize where as 1/3 of the players who did not make the switch, did not get the grand prize.
