### Hi Stranger!

As you can tell, I am an up and coming Software Engineer looking for more experience and foothold within this industry. I've always wanted to see what it was like being a Software Engineer and during the year of 2020, I have decided to fully commit to this route.

### 2021 Update:

I have graduated from [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/) and certified to be a Full-Stack Engineer! The year 2020 has been a rollercoaster and the career switch that I have decied to take has brought me to this stage! I am proud to say that I can now fully code an application from start to finish and I am looking forward to continuing my path as a SWE.


Please email me if you wish to communicate or collaborate! See you around!
