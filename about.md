### Hi Stranger!

As you can tell, I am an up and coming Software Engineer looking for more experience and foothold within this industry! I've always wanted to see what it was like being a Software Engineer and during the year of 2020, I have decided to fully commit to this route! 

Please email me if you wish to communicate or collaborate! See you around!
